# dagmc

Implementations of partition Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in R.

## Installation

You should be able to install directly from GitHub using the following:

devtools::install_github("mvar0005/dagmc", host="github.sydney.edu.au/api/v3", auth_token = 'auth_token')

You can get an 'auth_token' by following the instructions at:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

Let me know if you have issues with this though, as I haven't tested it!

## Current State

I am prototyping the partition MCMC algorithm (Kuipers & Moffa, 2015).

## Use

There is function documentation in the root directory. You can find some simple examples in the vignettes.

\title{Preprocessing for blacklisting.
Get the lowest pairwise scoring edges.}
\usage{
GetLowestPairwiseScoringEdges(scorer, n_retain)
}
\arguments{
\item{scorer}{A scorer object.}

\item{n_retain}{An integer representing the number of edges to retain.}
}
\value{
A boolean matrix of (parent, child) pairs for blacklisting.
}
\description{
Get the lowest c pairwise scoring edges represented as a blacklist matrix.
This blacklisting procedure is motivated by Koller & Friedman (2003). This
is rarely used now as we found that it blacklists edges that have significant
dependencies but are not in the top \eqn{n} edges. We prefer
the GetIncrementalScoringEdges method.

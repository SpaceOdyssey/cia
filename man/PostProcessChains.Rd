\alias{PostProcessChains}
\title{Index chains for further analysis.}
\usage{
PostProcessChains(chains, n_burnin = 0, n_thin = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{chains}{MCMC chains.}

\item{n_burnin}{Number of steps to remove at the start as a burnin. Default is 0.}

\item{n_thin}{Number of steps between retained states. Default is 1.}
}
\description{
This allows you to remove a burnin and thin the chains after processing. This
is mostly redundant as you can now index the cia_chain(s) objects directly.
}
